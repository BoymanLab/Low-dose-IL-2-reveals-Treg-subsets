# Low-dose-IL-2-reveals-Treg-subsets

Due to its stimulatory potential for immunomodulatory CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy has recently gained considerable attention for treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this investigator-initiated phase-2 clinical trial of low-dose IL-2 immunotherapy in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, we performed an in-depth study of circulating and cutaneous immune cells by imaging mass cytometry, high-parameter flow cytometry, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and targeted serum proteomics, building a comprehensive atlas of in vivo human immune responses to IL-2. Low-dose IL-2 stimulated various circulating immune cells, including Treg cells with skin-homing properties that appeared in the skin of SLE patients in close interaction with endothelial cells. Analysis of surface proteins, transcriptomes, and epigenomes detected different IL-2-driven Treg cell activation programs, including gut-homing CD38+, skin-homing HLA-DR+, and highly proliferative CD38+ HLA-DR+ Treg cells homing to inflamed tissues. These data identify functionally distinct human Treg cell subsets, including those most responsive to IL-2 immunotherapy.
